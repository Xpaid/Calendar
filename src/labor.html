    <p>
      Labor Day in the Philippines, observed on May 1st, honors the
      contributions and rights of workers. It commemorates the struggles and
      achievements of the labor movement, while providing a platform for
      workers' organizations to advocate for fair wages, improved working
      conditions, and social protection. Labor Day also offers workers a
      well-deserved break to relax and spend time with loved ones.
