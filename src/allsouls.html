      All Souls' Day, also called The Commemoration of All the Faithful
      Departed, is a day of prayer and remembrance for the faithful departed,
      observed by Christians on 2 November. Through prayer, intercessions, alms
      and visits to cemeteries, people commemorate the poor souls in purgatory
      and gain them indulgences.
