    <p>
      Christmas Eve is the evening or entire day before Christmas Day, the
      festival commemorating the birth of Jesus. Christmas Day is observed
      around the world, and Christmas Eve is widely observed as a full or
      partial holiday in anticipation of Christmas Day. Together, both days are
      considered one of the most culturally significant celebrations in
      Christendom and Western society.
