    <p>
      In the Gregorian calendar, New Year's Eve, also known as Old Year's Day,
      is the evening or the entire day of the last day of the year, 31 December.
      In many countries, New Year's Eve is celebrated with dancing, eating,
      drinking, and watching or lighting fireworks. Some Christians attend a
      watchnight service. The celebrations generally go on past midnight into
      New Year's Day, 1 January.
