      New Year 2024 is a global celebration that marks the beginning of the
      year. It is a time for people to come together, bid farewell to the past,
      and embrace new opportunities. With fireworks, parties, and symbolic
      rituals, individuals set resolutions and gather with loved ones to
      reflect, make positive changes, and look forward to a fresh start. It
      symbolizes hope, renewal, and the chance to embark on new adventures while
      leaving behind the challenges of the previous year.
