      Holy Saturday, also known as Great and Holy Saturday, the Great Sabbath,
      Hallelujah Saturday, Saturday of the Glory, Sabado de Gloria, and Black
      Saturday or Easter Eve, and called "Joyous Saturday", "the Saturday of
      Light", and "Mega Sabbatun" among Coptic Christians, is the final day of
      Holy Week, between Good Friday and Easter Sunday, when Christians prepare
      for the latter.
